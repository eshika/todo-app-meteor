This repo contains the code for a basic To Do App website made with Meteor and Svelte.

On this To Do App website, users can create and complete tasks which are added to a To Do List. This site has the additional functionalities of being able to delete tasks and filter by completion status. Also, the number of pending tasks are shown in the header of the site. All tasks are stored in a database using MongoDB, so the tasks remain on the site even after closing and reopening or refreshing the page.

The final site can be accessed here: https://eshika-todo-app-meteor.meteorapp.com/

The following tutorial was used as the basis for the code:
